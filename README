# WTW

###Model 1:
How many clients do we expect to get?  ->>> How many clients come back?

###Model 2:
Most demanding product for subsequent years. ->>> Which products we have lost and gained?

###Model 4:
Product recommendation. Taking an analogy to movies recommendation, when a user watches a movie 
it appears other movies might be recommendable based on user interest.
We could model a neural net capable of recommending products and services 
offered by WTW based on previous experiences.
This could be classified from industry -> products offered previously

Additional work: New incoming products to be added and the system would try to identify potential interested clients

###Model 5:



##discarted models:

###Model 3:
The amount of transaction to be made to clients. 
(If clients are buying Â£5000 worth of products for the past 5 years and might increase the amount of transaction)
